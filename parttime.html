        <p>This unit introduces students to the fundamentals of Wheel Throwing. Students will be guided on how to prepare their clay for the wheel and shown simple wheel throwing techniques. Students will make works on the wheel during this workshop. During the first session, students will prepare the clay and throw two basic shapes. In the second session, students will trim their work and prepare their piece for glazing and firing. Students will be able to keep 2 finished works from this workshop which will be collected at a later date.</p>

        <p> The Master of Arts in the Product Design programme develops the artistic and humanistic skills belonging to design culture together with the technical know-how that relates to production technology, materials, and manufacturing costs. It strives to meet the need of operating in a worldwide landscape of heightened competition where the designer can increase the value of a consumer product by creating innovation in both aesthetics and usability that takes advantage of available technologies and ever- changing consumer lifestyles.
         Learners will build an improved critical capability to explore contemporary design languages, focus on experimentation with innovative inter-disciplinary technologies and materials from preliminary concept to finish, focus on developing sustainable production and consumption processes.</p>
